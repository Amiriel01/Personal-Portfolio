                    <p>Hello, thanks for visiting my Portfolio Template project. I began learning to program because I
                        was
                        curious about what programming entailed. I was given a free curriculum resource by a friend and
                        decided to give it a try, from day one I was hooked. I've learned a lot along the
                        way and am happy to share some of my projects with you today! If you'd like to see my entire
                        GitHub
                        repository you can click the GitHub icon.</p>
